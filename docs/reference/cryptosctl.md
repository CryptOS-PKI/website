# ⌨️ cryptosctl command reference

:::tip[✅ Works today]
This describes CryptOS as it works right now.
:::

Every command and flag, in one place. `cryptosctl` is the only management tool for a standalone node, and it speaks the same API the Fleet Manager uses. `cryptosctl <command> --help` prints the same information on your machine.

`cryptosctl` runs on Linux and macOS.

## Connecting to a node

Every command that talks to a node picks one of three ways to connect:

| Mode | Flags | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| Mutual TLS (the default) | `--endpoint`, plus the identity and trust files | every installed node |
| Server TLS only | `--insecure` | a node in maintenance mode, which has no identity yet and asks for no client certificate |
| Local socket | `--socket /run/cryptos.sock` | on the node itself only; no TLS and no client certificate |

Mutual TLS always uses TLS 1.3. The identity is the bootstrap admin certificate and key from `cryptosctl bootstrap`. Before the node has its CA, the trust file is the node's current self-signed management certificate, pinned, which changes on every reboot. Once the node has its CA, its management certificate is CA-signed, and the trust file is your root certificate, which does not go stale. See [Reboot into the ceremony](../install-deploy/reboot-ceremony.md#trust-the-nodes-management-certificate).

## Global flags

These work with every command.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--endpoint` | `localhost:443` | the node's `host:port` |
| `--identity` | `~/.cryptos/identity.crt` | your client certificate (PEM) |
| `--identity-key` | `~/.cryptos/identity.key` | your client private key (PEM) |
| `--trust` | `~/.cryptos/trust.crt` | the pinned certificate the node must present (PEM) |
| `--server-name` | the host part of `--endpoint` | the name checked against the node's certificate; set it to the node's IP when you connect through a DNS name |
| `--insecure` | off | skip the client identity and do not verify the node; maintenance mode only |
| `--socket` | none | connect to the node's local UNIX socket instead, such as `/run/cryptos.sock` |
| `-o`, `--output` | `human` | `human`, `json` or `yaml`; `identity show` also accepts `pem` |

## Setup and status

### `bootstrap`

Makes the bootstrap admin identity on your workstation: an ECDSA P-256 key and a self-signed client certificate. It prints the certificate and its SHA-256 for the machine config's `bootstrap` section. It does not contact a node.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--common-name` | `cryptos bootstrap admin` | the certificate's common name |
| `--out-dir` | `~/.cryptos` | where `identity.crt` and `identity.key` are written |
| `--validity` | `8760h` (one year) | how long the certificate is valid |

### `status`

Shows the node's role, identity state, TPM and etcd health, boot count and software version, plus the revocation check, DNS resolver, enrolment protocols, a pending config reboot and clock sync when they apply. No flags.

### `version`

Prints the version, commit and build date of this `cryptosctl` binary. With `--endpoint` or `--socket` it also asks the node for its version, so a stale CLI or a node running the wrong image stands out. No flags.

### `identity show`

Shows the node's CA certificate: subject, issuer, serial, validity, SHA-256 and chain length. `-o pem` prints the chain as PEM. Fails with a hint to run the ceremony if the node has no identity yet.

### `identity validate`

Checks the node's certificate chain and prints `OK: certificate chain validates`.

### `completion`

Prints a shell completion script: `cryptosctl completion bash`, `zsh`, `fish` or `powershell`.

## Configuration and ceremony

### `config apply`

Sends a machine config. `cryptosctl` validates the file first and refuses unknown fields, then the node validates it again. On a maintenance node this is what installs the node.

:::danger[On a maintenance node this erases the disk]
A maintenance node that accepts the config wipes the disk named in `install.disk`. Check it before you apply.
:::

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-f`, `--file` | the machine config YAML (required) |
| `--yes` | skip the confirmation for `pki.allow_unverified_revocation_url` (for automation) |

:::danger[allow_unverified_revocation_url cannot be undone]
If the config turns on `pki.allow_unverified_revocation_url`, `cryptosctl` asks for a confirmation first, because every certificate issued while it is set carries a revocation address that was never checked. On a Root that includes every subordinate CA it signs. On a Root you must type the Root's common name; on other roles, `yes`.
:::

It prints `applied: generation=<n> requires_reboot=<true|false> digest=<sha256>`. Most changes need a reboot to take effect.

### `config get`

Prints the node's current machine config as YAML, ready to edit and send back with `config apply -f`. It includes the `acme` and `est` blocks, and a switched-off block is printed with `enabled: false` and its settings. Their secrets, `hmac_key_base64` and `password_sha256`, are write-only and print blank: leave a blank value as it is and `config apply` keeps the one the node stores for that `key_id` or username, or set it to replace it. A new `key_id` or username needs its secret. No flags.

### `ceremony start`

Runs the first-boot Root ceremony on a Root node: creates the CA key, self-signs the Root certificate, writes the signed ceremony manifest, and makes your bootstrap identity the node's administrator. It streams each step as it happens. It runs once per node.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--config` | the machine config YAML (required) |

:::danger[The ceremony runs once]
The Root's name, key type and lifetime are fixed by it. The only way to redo it is `reset`, which erases the CA key.
:::

## Certificate authority

The `ca` commands marked **child** run on the subordinate being set up, and **parent** on the CA that signs it.

| Command | Flags | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ca get-subordinate-csr` | | **child:** print this node's pending subordinate-CA CSR |
| `ca sign-subordinate` | `--csr` (PEM or DER, required), `--profile` (required) | **parent:** sign a child's CSR under a certificate profile |
| `ca submit-subordinate-cert` | `--chain` (PEM, leaf first, required) | **child:** install the chain the parent signed |
| `ca get-renewal-csr` | | **child:** print a CSR for the current CA key, to get a fresh certificate without a new key |
| `ca submit-renewed-cert` | `--chain` (PEM, leaf first, required) | **child:** install the re-issued certificate for the current key |
| `ca rotate-key` | | **child:** start a CA key rotation and print the CSR for the new key |
| `ca submit-rotation` | `--chain` (PEM, leaf first, required) | **child:** install the parent-signed chain for the rotated key |
| `ca issue-leaf` | `--csr` (PEM or DER, required), `--profile` (required), `--dns` (repeatable) | issue an end-entity certificate from a CSR |
| `ca list-issued` | | list the certificates this node has issued |
| `ca revoke` | `--serial` (hex, required; case, leading zeros, a `0x` prefix and colons are ignored, so `openssl x509 -serial` output works as it is), `--reason` (RFC 5280 reason code, default `0`) | revoke a certificate this node issued |
| `ca revocations` | | list this node's revoked certificates |
| `ca crl` | | print this node's revocation list as a table |
| `ca export-key` | `--out` (required), `--role`, `--yes` | export the CA key to a passphrase-encrypted backup file |
| `ca import-key` | `--backup` (required) | restore a CA from a backup file onto a fresh node |

:::danger[A revocation cannot be undone]
`ca revoke` has no reverse: neither `cryptosctl` nor the node can take a certificate off the revocation list. Check the serial before you run it. An unknown serial fails with `NotFound`, and the message shows the normalised serial the node looked up (lower case, no leading zeros).
:::

:::danger[The backup file holds the CA key]
Anyone with the file from `ca export-key` and its passphrase has the CA key. Keep the file offline and the passphrase apart from it.
:::

Notes:

- `ca issue-leaf --dns` replaces the profile's DNS names, and only works when the profile sets `allow_request_sans`.
- `ca export-key` asks for a new passphrase twice and for a confirmation: the Root's common name on a Root, `yes` on a subordinate. `--role root` or `--role subordinate` overrides the role read from the node, and `--yes` skips the confirmation. A TPM-backed node refuses the export, because its CA key cannot leave the TPM.
- `ca import-key` asks for the backup's passphrase, and refuses a node that already has an identity.

## Time-stamp authority

| Command | Flags | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `tsa certificates` | `--pem` | list every TSA certificate the node has signed timestamps with, newest first, marking the current one; `--pem` prints the certificates instead |

The list includes past certificates, and answers whether or not the TSA runs this boot, so tokens signed before a rotation can still be verified. See [Serve RFC 3161 timestamps](../using/serve-timestamps-tsa.md).

## Audit log

Both commands read the node's hash-chained audit log and change nothing. Over mutual TLS they need the bootstrap admin certificate, like `ca list-issued`. A node in maintenance mode answers `FailedPrecondition`. The walk-through is [Check the audit log](../using/audit-log.md).

### `audit list`

Lists audit entries, oldest first, one page at a time: sequence number, time, actor, call, outcome and a one-line summary. When there are more entries, the last line gives the `--page-token` for the next page. `-o json` and `-o yaml` give the entries as stored, with each entry's SHA-256, target and summary.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--since` | none | only entries at or after this time: RFC 3339, or a duration back from now such as `24h` |
| `--until` | none | only entries before this time, in the same forms |
| `--type` | none | only this call, by method name (`RevokeCertificate`) or full method (`/cryptos.node.v1.NodeService/RevokeCertificate`) |
| `--actor` | none | only entries whose actor subject contains this text; case-sensitive |
| `--page-size` | `0` (the node's default, 100) | entries per page; the node caps a page at 1000 |
| `--page-token` | none | continue from a previous page, with the same filters |
| `--all` | off | fetch every page |

### `audit verify`

Checks every entry's signature, that the sequence numbers run from 1 with no gaps, and that each entry carries the hash of the one before it. It prints `audit chain intact: <n> entries verified`, or where the chain broke and why, and then exits non-zero. `-o json` and `-o yaml` give `entry_count`, `intact`, `first_broken_sequence` and `reason`, with the same exit status. No flags.

## Image upgrades

<Pre10Notice />

These replace the node's CryptOS image without reinstalling it. The encrypted state (CA key, issued history, identity) is never touched. The node must have been built with an upgrade anchor; see [Secure Boot enrollment](../install-deploy/secure-boot.md).

| Command | Flags | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `image status` | | show the running and staged images |
| `image stage` | `--image` (the signed UKI), `--signature` (default `<image>.sig`) | upload a signed image; the node checks the signature before writing anything, keeps the current image for rollback, and does not reboot |
| `image activate` | `--confirm` (the CA common name) | reboot into the staged image |
| `image rollback` | | put the retained previous image back on the boot path; run `image activate` to boot it |

The full procedure is the [in-place upgrade guide](https://github.com/CryptOS-PKI/cryptos-appliance/blob/main/docs/image-upgrade.md).

## Power and reset

### `reboot`

Restarts the node through an orderly shutdown: it stops its listeners, closes etcd and the audit log, and locks the encrypted volume, which a hypervisor hard reset skips. Over mutual TLS it needs the bootstrap admin certificate.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--confirm` | the node's CA common name, to authorize the reboot |
| `--power-off` | power off instead of restarting; the node stays off until someone powers it on |

### `reset`

Erases the node's key material and reboots it into maintenance mode, so it can be given a new config and a new CA identity.

:::danger[reset cannot be undone]
Certificates the CA already signed stay valid until they expire, but nothing can issue, renew or publish a new revocation list for them. Export the key first with `ca export-key` if that matters (a TPM-backed node refuses the export).
:::

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--confirm` | the node's CA common name, to authorize the erase |
| `--yes` | skip the interactive confirmation (for automation) |

Over mutual TLS it needs the bootstrap admin certificate. After the reboot the node takes its address from DHCP, so on a network without DHCP it can only be reached from the console or hypervisor.
